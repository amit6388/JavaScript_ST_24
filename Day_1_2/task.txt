 A TASK FROM BASIC TO INTERMEDIATE LEVEL HAS BEEN GIVEN HERE, WHERE OPERATORS AND CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS ARE USED.
 YOU WERE INTRODUCED TO ALL THESE CONCEPTS IN THE BASICS OF C. 
 PLEASE TRY TO SOLVE ALL THE QUESTIONS.
 THERE ARE MANY TASKS BELOW WITH HINTS PROVIDED,WHICH YOU CAN USE FOR HELP.
 
        PLEASE MAKE A NEAT AND CLEAN NOTE (HARDCOPY) BASED ON YOUR UNDERSTANDING.
                    
					
					/*   BASIC Example of conditional statement*/

								  if (age >= 18) {
										console.log('Adult');
									} else {
										console.log('Not an adult');
									}


                                          /*   TASK DAY 1*/

1.Declare a variable named age and assign it your age. Then, use console.log to print the variable.

2.Create a constant variable PI and assign it the value 3.14. Print the value using console.log.

3.Declare a variable name with your first name and another variable lastName with your last name. 
      Concatenate these variables into a fullName variable and display it using console.log.
	   Hint-:let fullName = name + ' ' + lastName;
4. Create a variable isStudent and assign it a boolean value (true or false). Use alert to display
   the value of isStudent.
   
5.Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Use variables length and width, 
   and then display the area using console.log   
   
6.Use alert to display a message "Hello, India!". 

7.Create two variables, x and y, assign them numeric values, and use console.log to print their sum.

8.Display the result of the expression 10 % 3 using console.log to find the remainder of the division.
  
9.Create a variable greeting with the value "Good Morning". Use alert to display the greeting message.

10.Write a program that swaps the values of two variables, a and b, and displays the swapped values
     using console.log.  

11.Write a program that checks if a number n is even or odd and prints the result using console.log.
               Hint-:      if (n % 2 === 0)

12.Create a variable age and check if it is greater than or equal to 18. Use console.log to display 
   whether the person is an adult or not.	 
  
13.Use the ternary operator to check if a number num is positive, negative, or zero, and display the result
   using console.log.  
             Hint-:  let result = num > 0 ? 'Positive' : num < 0 ? 'Negative' : 'Zero';
 
14.Write a program that calculates the average of three numbers and displays it using console.log.
                    
15.Create a variable temperature and use a conditional statement to check if it is below freezing (0Â°C).
     Display a message using console.log based on the temperature.
	 msg=> 'It is freezing' OR 'It is not freezing'

16.Write a program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers and prints
   the results using console.log.	 
   
17.Use the ++ operator to increment a variable count and display the value using console.log.  
                    Hint-: count++;
						  
						  
18.Create a variable price and apply a 10% discount using the * operator. Display the discounted price using console.log. 
            Hint-:        let discountedPrice = price * (1 - discount);
	
	
19.Check if a number number is between 10 and 20 using relational operators and display the result using console.log.
      Hint-: let isInRange = if(number > 10 && number < 20);
	     msg=> 'number is between 10 and 20' OR 'number is not between 10 and 20'
	  
20.Write a program that converts a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9 and 
     display the result using console.log.
	 Hint-: let celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
	 
	 
	                                             /*   TASK DAY 2*/
												 
												 
												 
												 
1. Write a function that takes a string with a number and returns the integer value using parseInt.

2.Create a function that converts an input field value to an integer using parseInt and displays it 
  in an alert box.
  
3.Create a form with a text input field. Write a function that retrieves the value from the input field,\
      parses it with parseInt, and logs it to the console.  
	  
4.Write a JavaScript function that takes two input fields, parses their values with parseInt, adds them, and
   displays the result in console .	

5.Write a function to parse the value of an input field as an integer and check if it is greater than 10.
   Display a message  alert.   
   
6.Write a function to retrieve and parse the values from two input fields with parseInt, calculate their 
     average, and display the result in another input field.

7.Create a button that, when clicked, apply the css on the button like color, border, backgroundColor(camelCase),
    height,width  etc .	 
		
8.	Create img tag and a button  , when clicked on button , apply the css on the img tag like color, border, backgroundColor(camelCase),
    height,width etc .
	
9.Write a function that  calculate the simple interest and alert the result.
